  "description": [
    "A step in the style of a deck, finished with what is commonly referred to as the Yakisugi technique, involving charring of the wood with fire. Although usually attributed as a traditionally Japanese method, it has actually been used around the world for centuries.",
    "After charring, the top layer of the burnt Cedar was removed with a brass brush, leaving the underlying wood with a dark, rich color. Then sealed with a custom blend of tung oil, cedarwood oil and zinc oxide for water resistance, mold and mildew resistance and UV protection.",
    "With minimal effort, this can last a lifetime."
