        Hi 👋 I'm Nauras <img src="/images/nauras-profile.jpg" alt="Profile picture of Nauras" class="w-10 h-10 rounded-2xl mt-0 mb-0">

      <p>
        I've been a full-stack software engineer for 10+ years now.
        Most of my time has been spent in the role of Lead Engineer in team-based settings, with plenty of project and account management in between.
        I've done code integrations across multiple teams (across continents), I've set up processes and structures to keep things running smoothly and I've moved my fair share of juniors into intermediate positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can [build AI agents, implement complex UIs, integrate APIs, set up backends, servers, cron jobs and CI pipelines, scrape the web and so much more]
