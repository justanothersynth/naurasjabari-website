        "value": "<p>Each year, about 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide. However, it is well established that a combination of individual and population integrated interventions can prevent suicidal behaviours.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, providing appropriate medical and psychosocial responses to those at risk of self-harm is recognized as one of the most effective actions. However, such epidemiologically-sound, common-sense approaches are not necessarily straightforward to apply in clinical practice. To adapt their interventions, professionals are required to adequately evaluate the level of suicide risk. This evaluation requires probabilistic reasoning that integrates multiple, multi-level, contextualized parameters into a single overall assessment suitable for decision-making. To carry out this complicated but crucial task, one could refer to evidenced-based practices that propose to integrate “individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research”.</p><p>From a public health perspective, the matching between needs and interventions is a crucial condition for an efficient prevention strategy. As a consequence, policy makers and experts need robust criteria to determine the relevant populations to target and tailor the deployment of actions to the characteristics of these populations. Identifying the most at risk individuals is particularly important in developing efficient selective policies.</p><p>To face these challenges, both clinicians and policy makers need to rely on high quality evidence. In the field of suicidology, this comes from a considerable amount of studies that have tested the association between suicide-related outcomes and specific psychopathological, sociodemographic or environmental conditions, referred to as risk factors. However, analysis of this wealth of data is difficult due to the heterogeneity of study design and quality. To help clinicians and policy makers we have created the SURF data query application. </p><p>Finally, the SURF is intended to help researchers to quickly access the most up to date general or specific knowledge about suicide-related risk factors. With the application, it is easier and more convenient to build an evidence-based argument and refine research questions. </p>"
