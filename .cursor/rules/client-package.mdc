description: Vue 3, Nuxt, and client-side development patterns (excluding Convex functions)  
globs: packages/client/**/*
---

You are an expert in TypeScript, TSDoc, Node.js, NuxtJS, Vue 3, Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, VueUse and Tailwind v4.

**SCOPE**: This rule applies to client-side code only. Do NOT apply these patterns to Convex functions in the convex/ directory.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; never use options API.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.

Documentation
- Only use TSDoc tags that are listed in the TSDoc documentation
- Always write tsdoc comments or update existing ones when creating or editing functions
- Never format tsdoc comments with JSDoc-style '{type}'

Naming Conventions
- All files and directories must be named in kebab-case (e.g.: components/auth-wizard.vue, use-theme.ts).

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
- Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use template syntax for declarative rendering.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn Vue and Radix Vue, and Tailwind v4 for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind v4 CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Leverage Nuxt's built-in performance optimizations.
- Use Suspense for asynchronous components.
- Implement lazy loading for routes and components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions
- Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
- Prefer useState useState for state management.
- Prefer useNuxtData to access data  fetched by useAsyncData, useLazyAsyncData, useFetch, and useLazyFetch.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Never write import statements for components or composables. For other items that need importing from the codebase (such as types), use "@" instead of "~" in the import path.

Nuxt-specific Guidelines
- Follow Nuxt 3 directory structure (e.g., pages/, components/, composables/).
- Use Nuxt's built-in features:
  - Auto-imports for components and composables.
  - File-based routing in the pages/ directory.
  - Server routes in the server/ directory.
  - Leverage Nuxt plugins for global functionality.
- Use useFetch and useAsyncData for data fetching.
- Implement SEO best practices using Nuxt's useHead and useSeoMeta.

Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
- Use <script setup lang="ts"> syntax for concise component definitions.
- Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
- Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
- Implement custom composables for reusable logic.

Follow the official Nuxt.js and Vue.js documentation for up-to-date best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering and Routing.

**IMPORTANT**: When working with Convex functions (files in convex/ directory), defer to Convex-specific rules instead of these client-side patterns.
